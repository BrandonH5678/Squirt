# WaterWizard Claude Code Commands

Since terminal Claude Code has limited slash command support, use these **copy-paste prompts** instead:

## 1. Load Context
```
Load WaterWizard context from waterwizard-context.md and be ready to generate irrigation business documents.
```

## 2. Generate Contract
```
Generate a professional WaterWizard irrigation contract:
- Project: [PROJECT_NAME]
- Client: [CLIENT_NAME] 
- Zones: [NUMBER]
- Trench feet: [FEET]
- Soil type: [turf/rocky/clay/roots]

Use Kim Sherertz contract formatting standards. Include element pricing, materials/labor tables, validation, and CSV export.
```

## 3. Generate Invoice
```
Generate a WaterWizard invoice:
- Client: [CLIENT_NAME]
- Work description: [DESCRIPTION]
- Materials used: [LIST]
- Labor hours: [HOURS]

Include itemized table, proper formatting, and QuickBooks CSV export.
```

## 4. Validate Document  
```
Validate this WaterWizard document for:
- Required sections present
- Mathematical accuracy
- Professional formatting
- CSV export compatibility

[PASTE DOCUMENT CONTENT OR PROVIDE FILE PATH]
```

## 5. Show Pricing
```
Display current WaterWizard pricing for: [materials/labor/elements]

Include rates, typical costs, and last updated information.
```

## 6. Element Templates
```
Show me the template for: [valve_install/sprinkler_head/trenching_turf/pipe_assembly]

Include materials list, labor requirements, and typical pricing.
```

## Quick Usage Examples:

**Contract Generation:**
"Generate WaterWizard contract for Sprinkler Expansion, John Smith, 2 zones, 150 feet, turf soil"

**Invoice Generation:**  
"Create WaterWizard invoice for Jane Doe, sprinkler repair, 2 heads and 20ft pipe, 2.5 hours labor"

**Validation:**
"Validate this contract for completeness and accuracy: [paste content]"

**This approach gives you the same workflow power without requiring slash command support!**
