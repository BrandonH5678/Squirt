## Industry Standards & Best Practices

### Water Conservation & Native Plants
- **OSU Extension Service**: https://extension.oregonstate.edu/gardening/techniques/incorporating-pacific-northwest-native-plants-your-water-wise-landscapes
  - PNW native plants have natural tolerance for summer dry periods west of Cascade Mountains

- **Washington State University Water Conservation**: https://extension.wsu.edu/water/conservation/
  - Good irrigation scheduling maximizes efficiency by minimizing runoff and percolation losses
